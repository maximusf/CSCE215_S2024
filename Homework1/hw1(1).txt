For this Homework 1 assignment I created a github account and learned to use it within the linux terminal. To do this, I had to create a github repository named ".dotfiles".

Within the linux terminal, I created a directory on my computer called "github" and generated a key that I then saved within my github settings. This allowed me to control my github repository from my linux terminal. We created a README.md file and copied the .vimrc file from lab 02 and added them to the github directory.

After commiting the changes to the github directory, I was able to view the commit done through the ".dotfiles" repository on the github website. 

I didn't really encounter any issues other than getting confused because I couldn't see the copied .vimrc file until I did "ls -a".

Commands I used in section 4:
mkdir .dotfiles
ls -a
cd ./.dotfiles/
pwd
touch README.md
vim README.md
:wq
cat README.md
cp ~/.vimrc ~/.dotfiles/
git init
git add --all
git commit -m "INIT commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin git@github.com:<maximusf>/.dotfiles
git push -u origin main
